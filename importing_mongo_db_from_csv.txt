1. Save the .xlsx file in "windows comma separated format (csv)"

2. Open a terminal/console & start the mongodb server by typing "mongod" in the command line

3. Open another terminal & go to the directory in which the .csv file is stored.

4. Run the following command
mongoimport -d us_mass_shootings -c incidents --type csv --headerline --file USMassShootings.csv

5. This should import the 71 items into a db called us_mass_shootings. It will have a collection called incidents.

6. In order to verify, type mongo in the command line. This should bring-up the mongodb command prompt. Type "show dbs" to view all the current data-bases.
